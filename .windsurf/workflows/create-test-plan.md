# E2E Test Plan Generator

As an expert Senior QA Engineer and Test Strategist, generate comprehensive E2E test plans that ensure complete coverage of functional requirements, non-functional requirements, technical integrations, and data validations. This workflow produces ISTQB-aligned test plans with full traceability.

## Input Parameters

### $ARGUMENTS (Optional)
**Accepts:** spec.md path | design.md path | Feature name | Use Case ID (UC-XXX)
**Default:** `.propel/context/docs/spec.md` and `.propel/context/docs/design.md`

### --scope (Optional)
**Accepts:** `full` | `critical` | `regression` | `feature:<name>`
**Default:** `full`

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `full` | Complete system test plan covering all requirements |
| `critical` | P0/P1 critical paths only - focused test plan |
| `regression` | Stable features for regression testing |
| `feature:<name>` | Single feature/module test plan (e.g., `feature:login`) |

### Input Processing Instructions

**Step 1: Determine Sources**
| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Empty | Use `.propel/context/docs/spec.md` + `.propel/context/docs/design.md` |
| File path | Read specified file(s) |
| `UC-001` | Find UC in spec.md, related NFR/TR/DR in design.md |
| `Login` | Search spec.md + design.md for matching requirements |

**Step 2: Validate Input**
- If file path: Verify files exist
- If UC ID: Verify UC-XXX exists in spec.md
- If feature name: Find matching Use Cases and requirements

## Output

- **File**: `.propel/context/docs/test_plan_[feature].md`
- **Template**: `.propel/templates/test-plan-template.md`
- **Print** (console only):
  - List of rules used by the workflow in bulleted format
  - **4-tier Evaluation Report** (MUST use `evaluate-output.md` workflow - see `Quality Evaluation` section)

**Note:** **File Handling**: IF file exists â†’ UPDATE changed sections only (delta mode). IF file does not exist â†’ CREATE complete file.

## Core Principles

- **Traceability First**: Every test case links to FR-XXX, UC-XXX, NFR-XXX, TR-XXX, DR-XXX, or AIR-XXX
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: P0/P1 focus on high-impact, high-likelihood scenarios
- **Test Pyramid Compliance**: E2E limited to 5-10% covering critical journeys only
- **Full Given/When/Then**: Every scenario includes complete steps with test data
- **NFR Coverage**: Performance, security, and scalability specifications included
- **AI Coverage**: AI/LLM quality, safety, and operational requirements validated (if AIR-XXX present)

## Execution Flow

### Deep Research Methodology

**MCP Tools Required:**
- `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` - Requirement analysis, risk assessment
- `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` - Pin Playwright/testing framework versions
- `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - Fetch E2E best practices

**Fallback:** If MCP unavailable, use web search for "E2E test plan best practices 2026"

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
**Use:** `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`

1. Read `.propel/context/docs/spec.md`
   - Extract all Functional Requirements (FR-XXX)
   - Extract all Use Cases (UC-XXX) with success scenarios and alternatives
   - Identify actors, preconditions, postconditions

2. Read `.propel/context/docs/design.md`
   - Extract Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-XXX): performance, security, scalability
   - Extract Technical Requirements (TR-XXX): integrations, APIs, platform
   - Extract Data Requirements (DR-XXX): integrity, retention, migrations
   - Extract AI Requirements (AIR-XXX): AI functional, quality, safety, operational (if present)

3. **AI Detection Gate** (before --scope filter):
   ```
   Grep("AIR-\d{3}", ".propel/context/docs/design.md") â†’ air_requirements
   IF air_requirements.count > 0 â†’ Set AI_TESTING_REQUIRED = true
   ```

4. Apply --scope filter:
   | Scope | Action |
   |-------|--------|
   | `full` | Include all requirements |
   | `critical` | Filter to P0/P1 priority only |
   | `regression` | Filter to stable, baselined features |
   | `feature:<name>` | Filter to matching feature requirements |

### Phase 2: Risk Assessment
**Use:** `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`

1. Identify high-risk areas based on:
   - Business criticality (user-facing, revenue-impacting)
   - Technical complexity (integrations, new technology)
   - Historical defect density (if `.propel/learnings/findings-registry.md` exists)
   - Security sensitivity (authentication, authorization, data handling)

2. Assign risk scores:
   | Impact | Likelihood | Priority |
   |--------|------------|----------|
   | High | High | P0 |
   | High | Medium | P0 |
   | Medium | High | P1 |
   | Medium | Medium | P1 |
   | Low | Any | P2 |
   | Any | Low | P2 |

3. Document risks in Risk Assessment section

### Phase 3: Test Strategy Definition
**Use:** `mcp__context7__get-library-docs`

1. Define test pyramid allocation:
   - E2E: 5-10% (critical user journeys)
   - Integration: 20-30% (API contracts, service boundaries)
   - Unit: 60-70% (business logic, edge cases)

2. Identify E2E approach:
   - **Horizontal**: UI-driven user flows
   - **Vertical**: API â†’ DB validation for data integrity

3. Define environment strategy:
   - DEV: Smoke tests with mocked/seeded data
   - QA: Full regression with snapshot data
   - Staging: Pre-prod validation with prod-like data

4. Pin testing framework versions using `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id`

### Phase 4: Scenario Decomposition
**Use:** `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`

**Before writing test cases, list all scenarios to generate:**
| TC-ID | Requirement | Scenario Summary | Type | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------|----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Now expand each scenario listed above.**

For each requirement type, generate test scenarios:

**4.1 Functional Requirements (FR-XXX)**
For each FR, generate:
| Type | ID Pattern | Focus |
|------|------------|-------|
| Happy Path | TC-FR-XXX-HP | Normal successful flow |
| Edge Case | TC-FR-XXX-EC | Boundary conditions |
| Error Case | TC-FR-XXX-ER | Invalid inputs/failures |

**4.2 Use Cases (UC-XXX)**
For each UC, generate:
- Happy path covering main success scenario
- Alternative flows from extensions
- Error handling from exception paths

**4.3 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-XXX)**
For each NFR category:
| Category | Test Type | Tool |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Performance | Load test | k6/JMeter/Artillery |
| Security | Vulnerability scan | OWASP ZAP/Burp Suite |
| Scalability | Stress test | k6/Locust |

**4.4 Technical Requirements (TR-XXX)**
For each TR:
- Contract compliance tests
- Integration validation
- Error handling verification

**4.5 Data Requirements (DR-XXX)**
For each DR:
- Data integrity tests
- Referential integrity verification
- Audit trail validation

**4.6 AI Requirements (AIR-XXX)** [CONDITIONAL: If AI_TESTING_REQUIRED = true]

For each AIR, generate test scenarios based on requirement type:

| AIR Type | ID Pattern | Focus | Test Approach |
|----------|------------|-------|---------------|
| Retrieval Quality | TC-AIR-XXX-RQ | Context relevance, recall@k | Evaluation with test corpus |
| Response Quality | TC-AIR-XXX-RS | Faithfulness, coherence, completeness | LLM-as-judge or human evaluation |
| Hallucination | TC-AIR-XXX-HL | Ungrounded content detection | Factual consistency check |
| Latency | TC-AIR-XXX-LT | p95 response time vs target | Performance monitoring |
| Safety | TC-AIR-XXX-SF | Prompt injection, jailbreak resistance | Adversarial input testing |
| Token Budget | TC-AIR-XXX-TB | Token limit compliance | Token counting validation |
| Fallback | TC-AIR-XXX-FB | Graceful degradation | Confidence threshold testing |
| Guardrails | TC-AIR-XXX-GR | Input/output validation | Schema and content filtering |

**AI Test Categories:**

| Category | Description | Tool/Method |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Functional | Does AI produce expected output for known inputs? | Mocked LLM + assertions |
| Quality | Is output relevant, faithful, complete? | DeepEval, RAGAS, LangSmith |
| Safety | Does AI resist adversarial attacks? | OWASP LLM Top 10, Garak |
| Operational | Does AI meet latency/cost/token targets? | APM, custom metrics |

**AI E2E Test Scenarios:**
- End-to-end RAG pipeline: Query â†’ Retrieval â†’ Generation â†’ Validation
- Fallback path: Low confidence â†’ Deterministic response
- Error handling: Model timeout â†’ Graceful degradation
- Rate limiting: Burst traffic â†’ Circuit breaker activation

### Phase 5: E2E Journey Identification
**Use:** `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`

1. Identify critical user journeys spanning multiple Use Cases
2. Map journey: UC-001 â†’ UC-002 â†’ UC-003
3. Define session requirements (auth, state persistence)
4. Identify shared test data across journey phases
5. Define checkpoints for intermediate state validation

**E2E Journey Pattern:**
| Journey-ID | Name | UC Chain | Business Value | Priority |
|------------|------|----------|----------------|----------|
| E2E-001 | [Journey Name] | UC-001 â†’ UC-002 | [Critical value] | P0 |

### Phase 6: Traceability Matrix Generation

Create bidirectional traceability:
- Requirement â†’ Test Cases
- Test Case â†’ Requirements
- E2E Journey â†’ Use Cases

Validate coverage:
- All FR-XXX have at least one test case
- All UC-XXX have happy path + edge case coverage
- All NFR-XXX have validation approach defined
- All TR-XXX have integration tests
- All DR-XXX have data validation tests
- All AIR-XXX have AI quality/safety/operational tests (if AI_TESTING_REQUIRED)

### Phase 7: Template Population

1. Read `.propel/templates/test-plan-template.md`
2. Populate all sections with generated content
3. Include full Given/When/Then for each scenario
4. Include YAML test data specifications
5. Write to `.propel/context/docs/test_plan_[feature].md`

## Guardrails

- `rules/playwright-testing-guide.md`: Test independence, wait strategies **[CRITICAL]**
- `rules/playwright-standards.md`: Locator priority, anti-patterns **[CRITICAL]**
- `rules/playwright-typescript-guide.md`: Code quality, assertions
- `rules/unit-testing-standards.md`: Test patterns, coverage **[CRITICAL]**
- `rules/language-agnostic-standards.md`: KISS, YAGNI
- `rules/security-standards-owasp.md`: OWASP Top 10 alignment
- `rules/markdown-styleguide.md`: Front matter, heading hierarchy


## Quality Evaluation

**ALWAYS** Execute `.windsurf/workflows/evaluate-output.md` with these parameters:
- `$OUTPUT_FILE`:  `.propel/context/docs/test_plan_[feature].md`
- `$SCOPE_FILES`: Input source(s) provided to this workflow
- `--workflow-type`: `test-plan`

**Required Output:**
- Print 4-tier evaluation report to console in tabular format
- Always Use format defined in evaluate-output.md
- Include weighted Overall Score

**Prohibited:**
- Custom evaluation metrics (use evaluate-output.md only)
- Summarizing instead of full report

**Workflow Status:** Incomplete until Step 2 output is printed.
