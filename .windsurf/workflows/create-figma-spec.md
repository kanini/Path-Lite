# Create Figma Specification

As a Senior Product Designer and UX Architect, generate UX Requirements (UXR-XXX) and derive comprehensive screen specifications from requirements. Transform use cases and personas into a complete screen inventory with states, flows, and design system tokens. This workflow is the authoritative source for all UXR-XXX requirements.

## Input Parameters

### Primary Input
- `$ARGUMENTS`: Path to spec.md file (optional, defaults to `.propel/context/docs/spec.md`)

### Context Sources (Always Read)
- `.propel/context/docs/spec.md` - **REQUIRED** - Personas, use cases, FR-XXX (source for UI impact detection)
- `.propel/context/docs/design.md` - **OPTIONAL** - NFR, TR, DR for technical context
- `.propel/context/docs/epics.md` - **OPTIONAL** - For SCR-to-EP mapping if epics already exist
- `.propel/context/wireframes/` - **OPTIONAL** - Wireframe artifacts for entity understanding

### Input Validation
```
1. Check if spec.md exists (REQUIRED)
2. Scan spec.md for UI-related FR-XXX and UC-XXX:
   - FR-XXX containing: "display", "screen", "form", "UI", "interface", "dashboard", "page", "view"
   - UC-XXX with Actor = "User" AND visual interaction steps
   - Technology mentions: React, Angular, Vue, Flutter, iOS, Android, frontend
3. IF no UI-related requirements found -> EXIT with message "No UI impact detected in spec.md. Figma spec not required."
4. ELSE -> Proceed with UXR-XXX generation and specification generation
5. IF epics.md exists -> Use for SCR-to-EP mapping (optional enrichment)
```

## Output

### Artifact Generation
- `.propel/context/docs/figma_spec.md` - Screen inventory, states, flows, component mapping
- `.propel/context/docs/designsystem.md` - Design tokens, branding, component specifications

### Console Output (Do Not Save)
- List of rules used by the workflow in bulleted format
- **4-tier Evaluation Report** (MUST use `evaluate-output.md` workflow - see `Quality Evaluation` section)

**Note:**
- **File Handling**: IF file exists â†’ UPDATE changed sections only (delta mode). IF file does not exist â†’ CREATE complete file.
- Use `.propel/templates/figma-specification-template.md` for figma_spec.md structure
- Use `.propel/templates/design-reference-template.md` for designsystem.md structure

## Core Principles

### Screen Derivation First
- **NEVER** create arbitrary screens - derive ALL screens from use cases
- Each screen must trace back to one or more use cases (UC-XXX)
- Each screen must serve one or more personas
- Cover ALL use cases with appropriate screens

### Persona Coverage
- Every persona in spec.md must have a complete user journey
- Map screens to personas they serve
- Identify shared screens (serve multiple personas) vs persona-specific screens

### Flow Organization
- Organize prototype flows BY FLOW NAME (not by persona)
- Note which personas are covered by each flow
- Flows derived from use case sequences and epic workflows

### State Completeness
- Every screen requires 5 states: Default, Loading, Empty, Error, Validation
- Document triggers for each state
- Plan fallback content for each state

## Execution Flow

### Phase 0: UI Impact Gate
**Critical First Step - Validate UI Impact Exists in spec.md**

```
1. Read spec.md for FR-XXX and UC-XXX requirements
2. Detect UI impact by scanning for:
   - FR-XXX with keywords: "display", "screen", "form", "UI", "interface", "view", "page", "dashboard"
   - UC-XXX with visual interaction steps (Actor = User interacting with UI)
   - Technology mentions: React, Angular, Vue, Flutter, iOS, Android, frontend, web app, mobile app
3. IF no UI-related requirements found:
   - Output: "No UI impact detected in spec.md. Skipping Figma specification."
   - EXIT workflow
4. ELSE:
   - List UI-related FR-XXX and UC-XXX detected
   - Proceed to Phase 0.5 (UXR Generation)
```

### Phase 0.5: UXR-XXX Generation
**Generate UX Requirements based on UI-impacting Use Cases**

This workflow is the AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE for all UXR-XXX requirements.

**CRITICAL: Before writing any detailed UXR requirements, enumerate all items first:**

**Step 1 - List All UXR to Generate:**
Create a table listing all UXR requirements you will generate with a one-line rationale for each:

| UXR-ID | Category | Summary | Rationale |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| UXR-101 | Usability | Max 3 clicks to any feature | Discoverability requirement |
| UXR-201 | Accessibility | WCAG 2.2 AA compliance | Legal baseline |
| UXR-301 | Responsiveness | Mobile/tablet/desktop | Platform targets from spec.md |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Step 2 - Expand Each UXR:**
Now expand each UXR listed above with full specification.

**UXR Derivation Logic:**
```
FOR each UC-XXX with UI impact (detected in spec.md):
  1. USABILITY: Derive navigation requirements (max clicks, discoverability)
  2. ACCESSIBILITY: Apply WCAG 2.2 AA baseline requirements
  3. RESPONSIVENESS: Define breakpoint behavior from platform targets
  4. VISUAL DESIGN: Reference designsystem.md for consistency requirements
  5. INTERACTION: Define feedback requirements (loading, success, error states)
  6. ERROR HANDLING: Derive from UC-XXX alternative paths

FOR each persona:
  1. Identify accessibility needs (e.g., screen reader users)
  2. Add persona-specific UXR requirements
```

**UXR Categories:**
- **Usability** (UXR-1XX): Navigation, discoverability, efficiency (max 3 clicks, clear hierarchy)
- **Accessibility** (UXR-2XX): WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, assistive technology support
- **Responsiveness** (UXR-3XX): Breakpoint behavior, viewport adaptation
- **Visual Design** (UXR-4XX): Design system adherence, consistency
- **Interaction** (UXR-5XX): Feedback, loading states, animations (response within 200ms)
- **Error Handling** (UXR-6XX): Error messages, recovery paths

**UXR Output Format (for figma_spec.md Section 2):**
```markdown
| UXR-ID | Category | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria | Screens Affected |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| UXR-101 | Usability | System MUST provide navigation to any feature in max 3 clicks | Click count audit passes | All screens |
| UXR-201 | Accessibility | System MUST comply with WCAG 2.2 AA standards | WAVE/axe audit passes | All screens |
| UXR-301 | Responsiveness | System MUST adapt to mobile (320px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px+) | Responsive audit passes | All screens |
```

**UXR Numbering Convention:**
- UXR-001 to UXR-099: Project-wide requirements (generated first)
- UXR-1XX: Usability requirements
- UXR-2XX: Accessibility requirements
- UXR-3XX: Responsiveness requirements
- UXR-4XX: Visual design requirements
- UXR-5XX: Interaction requirements
- UXR-6XX: Error handling requirements

**Handling Unclear UX Requirements:**
- Mark ambiguous UXR with [UNCLEAR] tag when:
  - Accessibility needs conflict with design aesthetics
  - Responsive behavior not defined in source UC-XXX
  - Persona-specific needs unclear from spec.md
  - Visual design intent ambiguous from available references
- Document what clarification is needed
- Do NOT make assumptions about UX intent

### Phase 1: Spec Analysis (Sequential-Thinking MCP)
**MCP Tool:** `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`

**A. Persona Extraction:**
- Read all personas from spec.md
- Document persona goals, tasks, and pain points
- Identify primary vs secondary personas

**B. Use Case Analysis:**
- Extract all use cases (UC-XXX) from spec.md
- Map use case actors to personas
- Identify use case sequences and dependencies
- Note preconditions and postconditions

**C. Epic-to-Screen Mapping (Optional):**
- IF epics.md exists: Map screens to EP-XXX for traceability
  - Cross-reference spec.md for use case flows
  - Identify required screens from UC-XXX success scenarios
  - Map screens to personas and use cases
  - Note design references (Figma URLs, images) from epic
- ELSE: Skip epic mapping (epics will be created later with SCR references)

**Fallback Strategy (if Sequential-Thinking MCP fails):**
Manual structured analysis with explicit extraction phases.

### Phase 2: Screen Derivation
**Goal:** Derive complete screen inventory from use cases

**Screen Derivation Logic:**
```
FOR each Use Case (UC-XXX):
  1. Identify entry point screen
  2. Identify intermediate screens (steps in flow)
  3. Identify success outcome screen
  4. Identify error/alternative screens
  5. Map to persona(s) who execute this use case

CONSOLIDATE:
  - Merge duplicate screens (same screen from multiple use cases)
  - Identify shared vs unique screens
  - Assign screen IDs (SCR-XXX)
```

**UXR-XXX Requirement Mapping:**
```
FOR each UXR-XXX in spec.md:
  1. Identify which screen(s) address this UX requirement
  2. Document UXR-XXX ID in Screen Inventory table
  3. Flag any UXR-XXX without screen coverage

VALIDATION: All UXR-XXX must map to at least one screen.
IF orphan UXR-XXX found:
  - Create additional screen(s) to address the requirement, OR
  - Document why the UXR-XXX is not applicable to screens
```

**Screen Inventory Table Format:**
```markdown
| Screen ID | Screen Name | Derived From UC | UXR-XXX Mapped | Personas Covered | Priority | States Required |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|----------|-----------------|
| SCR-001 | Login | UC-001 | UXR-001, UXR-002 | All | P0 | 5 |
| SCR-002 | Dashboard | UC-002, UC-003 | UXR-003 | Admin, User | P0 | 5 |
| SCR-003 | Profile | UC-004 | UXR-004, UXR-005 | User | P1 | 5 |
```

### Phase 3: Wireframe Integration (Optional)
**Goal:** Extract entities and content structure from existing wireframes

```
IF .propel/context/wireframes/ EXISTS:
  1. Read information-architecture.md for navigation structure
  2. Read component-inventory.md for UI elements
  3. Extract entity types (forms, lists, cards, tables)
  4. Map entities to derived screens
  5. Incorporate content hierarchy
ELSE:
  - Proceed without wireframe context
  - Note: Screens will need entity definition during generate-figma
```

### Phase 4: Flow Definition
**Goal:** Define prototype flows organized by flow name

**Flow Structure:**
```markdown
## Flow: [Flow Name]
**Flow ID:** FL-XXX
**Derived From:** UC-XXX, UC-XXX
**Personas Covered:** [List of personas this flow serves]
**Description:** [Brief description of the flow purpose]

### Flow Sequence:
1. Entry: [Screen Name] / [State]
   - Trigger: [User action or system event]
2. Step: [Screen Name] / [State]
   - Action: [What happens]
3. Decision Point:
   - Success -> [Screen Name] / [State]
   - Error -> [Screen Name] / [Error State]
4. Exit: [Screen Name] / [Final State]

### Required Interactions:
- [Interaction 1]: [Description]
- [Interaction 2]: [Description]
```

**Minimum Required Flows:**
- At least one authentication flow (if applicable)
- At least one primary task completion flow
- At least one error recovery flow

### Phase 5: Component Identification
**Goal:** Identify required UI components from screens

**Component Categories:**
| Category | Components to Identify |
|----------|----------------------|
| Actions | Buttons, links, FABs |
| Inputs | Text fields, selects, checkboxes, toggles |
| Navigation | Headers, sidebars, tabs, breadcrumbs |
| Content | Cards, lists, tables, avatars |
| Feedback | Modals, drawers, toasts, alerts |

**Component Mapping:**
```markdown
| Screen | Components Required | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Login | TextField (2), Button (2), Link (1) | Email, password fields |
| Dashboard | Card (N), Table (1), Header (1) | Dynamic card count |
```

### Phase 6: Design System Generation
**Goal:** Create designsystem.md with tokens and specifications

**Token Sources (Priority Order):**
1. Design references from spec.md epics (Figma URLs, images)
2. Context7 MCP for framework defaults
3. Platform defaults (Material Design / iOS HIG / Fluent)

**Design System Sections:**
1. **Color Palette**
   - Primary, Secondary, Tertiary
   - Semantic (success, warning, error, info)
   - Neutral scale (50-900)
   - Light + Dark mode variants

2. **Typography**
   - Font families (heading, body, mono)
   - Size scale (H1-H6, Body, Caption)
   - Weights and line-heights

3. **Spacing**
   - Base unit (4px or 8px)
   - Scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)

4. **Border Radius**
   - Small (4px), Medium (8px), Large (16px), Full

5. **Elevation/Shadows**
   - Levels 1-5 with definitions

6. **Component Specifications**
   - Reference component inventory from Phase 5
   - Define variants per component

### Phase 7: State Specifications
**Goal:** Document required states for each screen

**State Matrix:**
```markdown
| Screen | Default | Loading | Empty | Error | Validation |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Login | Form ready | Authenticating | N/A | Invalid credentials | Field errors |
| Dashboard | Data loaded | Fetching data | No items | API error | N/A |
| Profile | User data | Loading profile | N/A | Load failed | Form errors |
```

**State Details Per Screen:**
```markdown
### SCR-001: Login

#### Default State
- Form fields visible and enabled
- Submit button active
- "Forgot Password" link visible

#### Loading State
- Submit button shows spinner
- Form fields disabled
- "Authenticating..." message

#### Error State
- Error banner at top
- "Invalid email or password"
- Retry option available

#### Validation State
- Inline field errors
- Red border on invalid fields
- Error messages below fields
```

### Phase 8: Output Generation

**A. Generate figma_spec.md:**
Using `.propel/templates/figma-specification-template.md`:
1. Source References (link to spec.md)
2. **UX Requirements (UXR-XXX)** - GENERATED IN THIS WORKFLOW (Section 2 of template)
3. Personas Summary (from spec.md)
4. Information Architecture / Navigation
5. Screen Inventory (derived, with UXR-XXX mapping and traceability)
6. Content & Tone
7. Data & Edge Cases
8. Branding / Visual Direction
9. Components / Design System Constraints
10. Prototype Flows (organized by flow, personas noted)
11. Export Requirements

**B. Generate designsystem.md:**
Using `.propel/templates/design-reference-template.md`:
1. Design Tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
2. Component Library Reference
3. Brand Guidelines
4. Figma/Image Asset References (from spec.md)

### Phase 9: Validation
**Goal:** Ensure complete coverage

**Validation Checks:**
- [ ] Every use case (UC-XXX) maps to at least one screen
- [ ] Every persona has screens covering their primary goals
- [ ] Every screen has all 5 states defined
- [ ] Every flow has entry, steps, and exit defined
- [ ] Design tokens are complete (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows)
- [ ] Component inventory covers all screen requirements
- [ ] **Every UXR-XXX maps to at least one screen (no orphan UXR)**

## Guardrails
- `rules/figma-design-standards.md`: File structure, components, tokens, exports
- `rules/ui-ux-design-standards.md`: Design tokens, component states
- `rules/web-accessibility-standards.md`: WCAG 2.2 AA, contrast, focus states
- `rules/ai-assistant-usage-policy.md`: Explicit commands; minimal output
- `rules/dry-principle-guidelines.md`: Single source of truth; delta updates
- `rules/markdown-styleguide.md`: Front matter, heading hierarchy


## Quality Evaluation

**ALWAYS** Execute `.windsurf/workflows/evaluate-output.md` with these parameters:
- `$OUTPUT_FILE`:  `.propel/context/docs/figma_spec.md`
- `$SCOPE_FILES`: Input source(s) provided to this workflow
- `--workflow-type`: `figma-spec`

**Required Output:**
- Print 4-tier evaluation report to console in tabular format
- Always Use format defined in evaluate-output.md
- Include weighted Overall Score

**Prohibited:**
- Custom evaluation metrics (use evaluate-output.md only)
- Summarizing instead of full report

**Workflow Status:** Incomplete until Step 2 output is printed.
