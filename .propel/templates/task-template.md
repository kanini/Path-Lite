### **CRITICAL: Wireframe Implementation Requirement (UI Tasks Only)**
**IF Wireframe Status = AVAILABLE or EXTERNAL:**
- **MUST** open and reference the wireframe file/URL during UI implementation

- **MUST** implement all states shown in wireframe (default, hover, focus, error, loading)
- **MUST** validate implementation against wireframe at breakpoints: 375px, 768px, 1440px
- Run `/analyze-ux` after implementation to verify pixel-perfect alignment

| **Mobile Framework** | [React Native / Flutter / SwiftUI / Jetpack Compose / Kotlin Multiplatform / N/A] |

> **Mobile Impact Legend:**
> - **Yes**: Task involves mobile app development (native or cross-platform)
> - **No**: Task is web, backend, or infrastructure only
>
> If Mobile Impact = No, all Mobile references should be N/A

### **CRITICAL: Mobile Implementation Requirement (Mobile Tasks Only)**
**IF Mobile Impact = Yes:**
- **MUST** verify platform-specific headless compilation succeeds before marking complete
