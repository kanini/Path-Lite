## 1. Test Objectives
- [Objective 1: Quality attribute being validated]
- [Objective 2: User journeys covered]
- [Objective 3: Risks being mitigated]

## 2. Scope

### In Scope
| Category | Items | Requirement IDs |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Functional | [Features] | FR-001, FR-002 |
| User Journeys | [Critical flows] | UC-001, UC-002 |
| Non-Functional | [Performance, Security] | NFR-001, NFR-002 |

| AI Models | [Model accuracy, inference reliability] (if AIR-XXX) | AIR-001, AIR-002 |

### Out of Scope
- [Items explicitly excluded with rationale]

## 3. Test Strategy

### Test Pyramid Allocation
